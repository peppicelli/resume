description = "Most of my professional experiences have been in an **Agile** environment. I have certifications from the **[Scrum Alliance](https://www.scrumalliance.org/)** for the roles of **Product Owner** and **Scrum Master**. I did assume both positions in my career. But more than Scrum, I do enjoy any methodology that encourages **team collaboration**, **efficiency** and **continuous delivery**."

description = "Most of my professional experiences have been in an **Agile** environment. I have certifications from the **[Scrum Alliance](https://www.scrumalliance.org/)** for the roles of **Product Owner** and **Scrum Master**. I did assume both positions in my career. But more than Scrum, I do enjoy any methodology that encourages **team collaboration**, **efficiency** and **continuous delivery**. I also have experience with medical regulation, especially [**ISO 13485**](https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html) and [**IEC 62304**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_62304)."

description = "In my previous jobs, I became familiar with some well known (and some less well known) frameworks: **[QT](https://www.qt.io/)**, **[AngularJS](https://angular.io/)**, **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)**, **[Python Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)**, **[Apache Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/)**, **[Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) & [Bower](https://bower.io/)**, **[CMake](https://cmake.org/)**, **[Puppet](https://puppet.com/)**  and **[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/)**. I'm a quick learner and I always enjoy discovering new tools and frameworks (as for this CV done with **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**). As for the operating system, I know my way around ***nix servers**, **[QNX](http://www.qnx.com)** (real time OS for embedded system) and **Windows**."

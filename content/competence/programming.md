description = "I started programming on a Comodore 64 at the age of 8. 18 years later, I received a Master degree of Computer Engineering from the **Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne (EPFL)** with a **GPA of 5.5 on 6**. Afterwards, I had professional experiences in `Java`, `C++`, `Python` and `Javascript`. But I don't want to limit myself to these since I strongly believe that every language has a purpose and may prove itself useful on some tasks (except Visual Basic)."

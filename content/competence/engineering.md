description = "I did learn software engineering in environments where build systems, source control, code reviews, bug databases, test and test coverage enforcement are standard practices. I did enjoy it and for my next job, I hope to be part of a software team with a high mark on the famous [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/). As for the tools, I did work with [**GIT**](https://git-scm.com/), [**SVN**](https://subversion.apache.org/), [**Jenkins**](https://jenkins.io/), [**CruiseControl.Net**](http://www.cruisecontrolnet.org/), [**Gerrit**](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/), [**Crucible**](https://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible),[**JIRA**](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and  [**VersionOne**](https://www.versionone.com/) among others."

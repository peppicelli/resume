project = "The **Neurorobotics Platform (NRP)** developed in the Human Brain Project (HBP) is an Internet-accessible simulation system that allows the simulation of **robots** controlled by **spiking neural networks**. It targets researchers of multiple fields. Prospected users, include but are not limited to neuroscientists,  wanting to validate brain models in the context of closed action-perception loops as well as robotics researchers wanting to develop new neuro-inspired controllers."
main_achievements = [
  "I did convince our academic external partners as well as our reviewers to adopt an **Agile** methodology instead of the usual academic *\"deliver everything the day before the deadline\"*",
  "I did put a lot of efforts into getting knowledge and reusing software components made by other groups at the *Human Brain Project* (there are 12 subprojects). Our team ended up sharing tools for `Javascript`, `C++` (`CMake` template) & `Python` with the other groups.",
  "The **Neurorobotics Platform** did pass the first and second reviews by the European Union with excellent marks."
]
responsabilities = [
  "Coordination and active participation in the gathering of the requirements and the specification of the platform.",
  "Architecture workshops organization with all the external partners.",
  "**Agile environment** setup & training for internal and external partners. After one year, two fully Agile and efficient teams were working on the platform. I took briefly the role of **Scrummaster** (for 6 months) and **product owner** (for 6 months) before other team members could assume the positions.",
  "Software development, especially around an `Angular` front-end and a set of `Python` REST services.",
  "Setup of a complete continuous delivery pipeline including the build system, the code coverage enforcement (along with metrics and KPIs), the package management (`RPMs`,`npm` & `pypy`) and deployments (using **puppet & openstack**)",

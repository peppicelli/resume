project = "The [**Neurorobotics Platform (NRP)**](https://neurorobotics.net/) developed in the [**Human Brain Project**](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/) (HBP) is an Internet-accessible simulation system that allows the simulation of **robots** controlled by **spiking neural networks**. It targets researchers of multiple fields. Prospected users, include but are not limited to neuroscientists,  wanting to validate brain models in the context of closed action-perception loops as well as robotics researchers wanting to develop new neuro-inspired controllers. The platform code [can be found on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/hbpneurorobotics/)."

main_achievements = [
  "The [**Neurorobotics Platform**](https://neurorobotics.net/) did pass the first and second reviews by the European Union with excellent marks.",
  "I did put a lot of efforts into getting knowledge and reusing software components made by other groups at the *Human Brain Project* (there are 12 subprojects). Our team ended up sharing tools for `Javascript`, `C++` (`CMake` template) & `Python` with the other groups.",
  "I did convince our academic external partners as well as our reviewers to adopt an **Agile** methodology instead of the usual academic *\"deliver everything the day before the deadline\"*",
]

responsabilities = [
  "Web development, especially around an [**Angular**](https://angularjs.org/) front-end and a set of `Python` REST services (with the help of [**Flask**](http://flask.pocoo.org/)).",
  "`C++` development of a multiscreen graphic renderer for the robot simulator [**Gazebo**](http://gazebosim.org/) using a framework called [**Equalizer**](http://eyescale.github.io/equalizergraphics.com/).",
  "Coordination and active participation in the gathering of the requirements and the specification of the platform.",
  "Architecture workshops organization with all the external partners.",
  "**Agile environment** setup & training for internal and external partners. After one year, two fully Agile and efficient teams were working on the platform. I took briefly the role of **Scrummaster** (for 6 months) and **product owner** (for 6 months) before other team members could assume the positions.",
  "Setup of a complete **continuous delivery pipeline** including the build system (with versioning), the code coverage enforcement (along with metrics and KPIs), the package management (`RPMs`,`npm` & `pypy`) and deployments (using [**puppet**](https://puppet.com/) and [**openstack**](https://www.openstack.org/)).",

captions = [
  "Rendering of the platform on a Display Wall powered by a graphical cluster.",
  "The platform allows to programs the neuron models and their effect on the robots in python from your browser",
  "Behind the scene, ROS (robot operating system), Gazebo (robot simulator).",
  "The spiking activity of the neural network as well as the sensors and actuators data can be monitored from the browser as well.",
  "Some part of the code, for example the rendering improvements, have been submitted in integrated in the open source tools used in the platform."]

project = "**Kollmorgen Automation Suite (KAS)** is composed of a Windows programming environment (IDE) and of servo-drive embedded controllers. The target market is industrial assembly line automation. The IDE supports all `IEC 61131-3` (PLC) programming languages and is fully integrated with motion programming, hardware setup and configuration, testing and debugging, HMI development, network setup and other development tools. The embedded controllers run on `Windows XPe` and `QNX` (a real time POSIX operating system). They use `EtherCAT` and `modbus` field buses and they do ensure all the real time constraints for a multi-axis and multi sensors setup."
main_achievements = [
  "I did rewrote the network driver of `QNX` specifically for `EtherCAT`. `EtherCAT` is an industrial bus based on Internet. The result: **a 60% average time gain** in sending and receiving Ethernet frames which allowed the whole system to run at a 4Khz frequency.",
  "The whole development team was looking towards increasing our test code coverage. I introduced a **Model View Controller** way to code new `QT` based features for our programming environment. It became the standard.",
  "I did lead the search and the implementation of a highly efficient web server to run on our embedded system."]
responsabilities = [
  "`QT` & `C++` development on the Windows programming environment.",
  "`C++` development on the embedded controllers.",
  "Fieldbuses implementation (mainly EtherCAT).",
  "`Javascript`/`HTML5`/`JQuery` development for a web based interface to the embedded controller.",
  "Third level support for critical bugs & issues in the field.",
  "Technical coaching of a remote Indian development team.",
  "High focus on quality: **unit tests**, **system and manual tests**, **TDD** (Test Driven Development), **checklists**, **code team inspections** and **continuous integration** with multiple validation steps."]

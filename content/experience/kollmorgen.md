project = "[**Kollmorgen Automation Suite (KAS)**](http://www.kollmorgen.com/en-us/products/machine-controls/automation-platform/kollmorgen-automation-suite/kollmorgen-automation-suite-overview/) is composed of a Windows programming environment (IDE) and of servo-drive embedded controllers. The target market is industrial assembly line automation. The IDE supports all `IEC 61131-3` (PLC) programming languages and is fully integrated with motion programming, hardware setup and configuration, testing and debugging, HMI development, network setup and other development tools. The embedded controllers run on **Windows XPe** and [**QNX**](http://www.qnx.com) (a real time POSIX operating system). They use [**EtherCAT**](https://www.ethercat.org/default.htm) and [**modbus**](http://www.modbus.org/) field buses and they do ensure all the real time constraints for a multi-axis and multi sensors setup."
main_achievements = [
  "I did rewrite the network driver of [**QNX**](http://www.qnx.com) (for a QorIQÂ® P2020 processor) specifically for [**EtherCAT**](https://www.ethercat.org/default.htm). [**EtherCAT**](https://www.ethercat.org/default.htm) is an industrial bus based on Ethernet. It resulted in a **60% average time gain** in sending and receiving Ethernet frames. This allowed the whole system to run at a 4Khz frequency.",
  "The whole development team was looking for ways to increase our test code coverage. I introduced a **Model View Controller** way to code new [**QT**](https://www.qt.io/) based features for our programming environment. It became the standard.",
  "I did lead the search and the implementation of a highly efficient web server to run on our embedded system."]
responsabilities = [
  "`C++` & [**QT**](https://www.qt.io/) development on the Windows programming environment.",
  "`C++` (using C++11) development on the embedded controllers. ([**QorIQ**](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/power-architecture-processors/qoriq-platforms:QORIQ_HOME) family and [**QNX**](http://www.qnx.com) OS)",
  "Fieldbuses implementation (mainly [**EtherCAT**](https://www.ethercat.org/default.htm)).",
  "`Javascript` / `HTML5` / [**JQuery**](https://jquery.com/) development for a web based interface to the embedded controller.",
  "Third level support for critical bugs & issues in the field.",
  "Technical coaching of a remote Indian development team.",
  "High focus on quality: **unit tests**, **system and manual tests**, **TDD** (Test Driven Development), **checklists**, **code team inspections** and **continuous integration** with multiple validation steps."]

project = "The Roche Molecular Systems diagnostic division is building blood analysis machines, especially using a method called [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction). These machines deliver data that have to be further analyzed using complex mathematics. The project was about an internal tool to help mathematicians implement and test their algorithms against data coming from all models of PCR blood analysis hardware."
main_achievements = [
  "Some data was accessible from a **Microsoft SQL server** database. The tool was behaving fine when used from the same network as the SQL server. But when the tool was used outside (from a VPN for example), the performances were really bad. I did analyze and rewrote most of the SQL queries in the code until the performances were the same from inside and from outside the network.",
  "I rewrote the serialization part in order to move from binary to properly documented **XML** (for an increased maintainability and an easier backward compatibility when changing the data format)."

work_certificate_excerpt = "During this time, Daniel worked closely with all team members and stakeholders to re-architect the business and interface logic. Daniel's role was critical in this effort. He proposed wonderful new ideas and worked with the team successfully to implement the agreed upon solutions. In doing this, Daniel was involved throughout the entire design process."

project = "[**Atracsys**](https://www.atracsys-measurement.com/) develops optical measurement solutions for the medical industry. The leading products are the fusionTrack 500, the fusionTrack 250 and the spryTrack 180. These devices are able to detect and track in 3D reflective spheres, disks and IR-LEDs in real-time video streams. They are composed of two cameras that observe reflective and/or active fiducials (IR LEDs) simultaneously, and they triangulation to calculate their locations with unrivaled precision and with an unparalleled non-interpolated measurement rate of 335 Hz."

responsabilities = [
  "`C++` development on embedded platforms running Linux using modern `CMake` and `C++11`.",
  "`C++` & [**QT**](https://www.qt.io/) development on Windows and Linux.",
  "Embedded Linux image maintenance using [**Yocto**](https://www.yoctoproject.org/), `bash scripting` and `python`",
  "Active participation in the design and implementation of the tracking and detection algorithms.",
  "Full stack Bluetooth Low Energy development, from the embedded platform using [*Silicon labs* Bluegiga chips](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/bluegiga-bluetooth-smart-software-stack) to an [**Android** application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atracsys.sprytrackdemo).",
  "Installation, maintenance, training and transition to a full Continuous Integration pipeline using [**gitlab**](https://about.gitlab.com/community/), [**jenkins**](https://jenkins.io/), [**openLDAP**](https://www.openldap.org/), [**Bacula**](https://blog.bacula.org/) and [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/).",

main_achievements = [
  "I did setup, train and convince [**Atracsys**](https://www.atracsys-measurement.com/) to use a full continuous integration pipeline. The challenge here was in the variety of building tools (FPGA compilers, chip specific compilers, cross compilers, languages environment, ...) and infrastructure tools (source control system, ldap server, samba server to save artifacts, backup suite,...). Instead of installing all these tools \"traditionally\", I trained myself to use [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/). All the infrastructure at [**Atracsys**](https://www.atracsys-measurement.com/) is now running on [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) containers. All project have their own build containers. On top of that, every software is validated according to [**ISO 13485**](https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html).",
